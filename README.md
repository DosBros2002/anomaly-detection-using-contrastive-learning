# Transformer-Based Anomaly Detection in Time Series

This repository contains the implementation of an anomaly detection system for time series data, utilizing a Transformer-based autoencoder within a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework. The model incorporates contrastive loss to address the challenge of overfitting, making it suitable for complex multivariate time series data.

## Features

- **Data Augmentation:** Uses geometric distribution masks to augment the data for robust training.
- **Transformer Autoencoder:** Leverages the power of Transformer architectures to capture complex temporal dependencies in the data.
- **Generative Adversarial Network:** Enhances the robustness of anomaly detection through adversarial training.
- **Contrastive Loss:** Improves model generalization by enforcing the model to learn distinguishable features for different classes.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The code is tested with Python 3.8+. You can install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Clone this repository to your local machine:


Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

- `torch>=1.8.1`
- `transformers>=4.5.1`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these manually or use the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository:

```bash
pip install torch transformers pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To run the anomaly detection model, you can use the following command:

```bash
python run_anomaly_detection.py
```

Make sure to adjust paths to your dataset files within the script or specify them as command-line arguments if you modify the script to accept them.

## Data Format

Your dataset files should be in CSV format. The expected format is:

- `train.csv`: Training data without labels.
- `test.csv`: Test data without labels.
- `test_label.csv`: Labels for the test data.

Each row in the dataset files should represent a data point in the time series.
